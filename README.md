Two-letter username on Github
=============================


Description:
------------
This is a script to check if there are any two-letter usernames available on
Github because they are clearly superior.

Currently (as of April 4 2015), there are none available.
I got the last one >:D!
Although one may become available if an account is deleted.


Usage:
------
Requires python 2.7, mechanize, and BeautifulSoup.  
To run:

        python twoletter.py

Disclaimer: I don't actually know how to code python.
It takes about 15 minutes to run.
